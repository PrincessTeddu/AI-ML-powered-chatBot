# AI-ML-powered-chatBot

This code includes a password recovery feature where users can retrieve their password by providing their username and email. It also integrates SQLite3 for database management, allowing for secure storage of user credentials. However, remember to handle sending the recovered password securely in a real-world scenario, such as via email with proper encryption and verification processes.


For Output I used an Example:

In this example:

Alex registers with the username "alex", email "alex@example.com", and password "myPassword".
Alex logs in successfully and interacts with the chatbot.
Alex exits the application.
Alex requests a password recovery and provides her username and email. He receives his password.
Alex exits the application again.
